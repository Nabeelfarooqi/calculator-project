# Calculator Project
Calculator project developed incrementally, starting with a Java implementation and later ported to Arduino C++ to explore expression parsing and embedded systems design.

## Versioning Strategy
Each version is implemented in both Java and Arduino C++.
The goal is to preserve identical calculator behavior while porting logic between languages.

### v1.0
- Java calculator
- Left-to-right evaluation
- Supports +, -, *, /
- No operator precedence (PEMDAS not implemented)

### v2.0 (Planned)
- Operator precedence (* and / before + and -)
- Arduino port with serial input

## How to Run Java v1
1. Compile the Java file:
2. Run:
3. Enter numbers and operators interactively in the console. Use `=` to see the final result.
